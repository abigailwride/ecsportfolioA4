           <h3>Spotlight on Opportunities from Music</h3>
         </p>
            <p>Music has allowed me to do two of my favorite things: Play music, and Travel!</p>
            <p>
                  Playing the flute has allowed me to travel to various countries and meet many well-known and talented musicians. I began playing flute in 6th grade going to Churchill Jr. High. I very resentfully and grudgingly went to my lessons and then neglected to practice the rest of the week. 
               After about a year of never practicing I had a particularly bad lesson, I decided to get off my butt and pick up my flute. I set many goals and began to get better and better.
               In the next couple of years, I made it successfully into a prestigious music conservatory in downtown Salt Lake City and placed in many competitions, often through the Utah Flute Association. 
               I began taking lessons from the previous flute professor of Brigham Young University April Clayton, leading to more opportunities I wouldn't have otherwise. Over just the past year, I met the worlds best flute player Emanuel Pahude at an exclusive event, flew with my teacher and other BYU students to multiple countries in Europe to perform, 
               and got to touch the lives of the people whom we performed for. Playing with April Clayton and having these experiences, I gained the confidence to audition for Utah's best youth orchestra, the Lyceum Philharmonic, and made it in!
               This summer we are touring to NYC to play in the Lincoln Center. Taking my music more seriously in my life has allowed me to do many things that have turned me into the person I am today!
